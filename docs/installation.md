Tracm is a python package and can be installed easily using pip. 

```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/gtonkinhill/tracm
```

This is all that is needed for the pairwise distance and clustering commands. To generate alignments you will also need to install [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) and [htsbox](https://github.com/lh3/htsbox).
